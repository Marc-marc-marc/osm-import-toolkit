=======================

The import wiki is [here][http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MassGIS_DEP_Wetlands_Import_2013]. It can be used as a template and to give more context around this code.

It is designed to import the remaining ponds and lakes into MA, using the MassGIS as its data source. It makes efforts to skip ponds and lakes that are already imported. It is looks up the name from the PALIS_ID. Everything up to the staging step is completed.
